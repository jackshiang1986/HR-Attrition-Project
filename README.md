# HR Attrition Project

This project serves as the Summative Assessment for module "Data Queries and Visualization Basics" of Professional Diploma in Data Science of Lithan Academy.

## Project Overview
The background of this project is to investigate the attrition of the company, which is found to be at an alerting level (16.12%, which is higher than the general threshold at around 10% for good attrition rate). The data (HR_Attrition_converted.xlsx) used for this project consists of 1471 rows (column header + 1470 employees) and 34 columns (attributes) and collected in the past 12 months. In the data set, several key information of the employees, for example, their demographics (gender, age etc.), department, income level, their feedback on relationships and work-life balance etc., will be used for study of the attrition.

## Objectives of the Project
The following are the objectives of the project:
   1. Compile a report using Power BI Services and its visualization tools to provide meaningful insights from the raw data set
   2. Find out those main factors for the attrition
   3. Provide recommendations to the company with the aim of reducing attrition back to healthy state (<10%)

## Project Outline
Before loading the dataset into Power BI Services, the raw dataset shall be checked and pre-processed if required. For this project, the numerical coding for some categorical columns are replaced with proper text descriptions, which can provide better clarity during data visualization stage in Power BI Services.

The next step after data pre-processing is to import the dataset into Power BI Services. Several types of visualizations, such as donut chart, bar chart, tree map etc. are utilized where appropriate for finding insights. Finally, based on the insights found from those visualizations, some recommendations can be provided to the company with the aim of reducing the attrition back to healthy state (<10%). Finally, the report done in Power BI Services can be shared with relevant parties.
