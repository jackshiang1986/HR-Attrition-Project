# HR Attrition Project

The background of this project is to investigate the attrition of the company, which is found to be at an alerting level (16.12%, which is higher than the general threshold at around 10% for good attrition rate). The data used for this project consists of 1471 rows (column header + 1470 employees) and 34 columns (attributes) and collected in the past 12 months. In the data set, several key information of the employees, for example, their demographics (gender, age etc.), department, income level, their feedback on relationships and work-life balance etc., will be used for study of the attrition.

The 3 main objectives of this project are:
   1. Compile a report using Power BI Services and its visualization tools to provide meaningful insights from the raw data set
   2. Find out those main factors for the attrition
   3. Provide recommendations to the company with the aim of reducing attrition back to healthy state (<10%)
